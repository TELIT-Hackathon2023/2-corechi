Hi! Here's the description of the folder contents.

You can find the challenge description in the "TARDIS AI Chatbot challenge description.docx" file.

The "customer_handbook" folder contains all the documents we have regarding TARDIS components. It's your base to build your chatbot on. It contains a lot of information in MD format, plus a lot of images explaining how TARDIS works.

"Scenarios.docx" describes different flows and questions -- for you to test your solution.

"SD_Tickets.docs" file describes the Service Desk tickets process and how it is working now. You will need it if you decide to integrate your chat-bot with Jira.

"rover_logs.txt" and "cloudWalker_logs.txt" are here to help you with testing the additional task -- recognizing the problematic component based on logs.

The "chevron" folder is here to test the new files uploaded by an admin (additional functionality). You can find a test scenario described in "Scenarios.docx"
