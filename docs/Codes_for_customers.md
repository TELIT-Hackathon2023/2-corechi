# Sample Code


We also provide sample codes for customers in order to ease implementation at their end. The code is hosted on the [Magenta CICD GitLab](https://gitlab.devops.telekom.de/tardis/samplecode), which is a public platform. You can just create an account, if you don't already have one.
If you want to provide sample code or so-called reference implementation, you can submit it [here](https://gitlab.devops.telekom.de/tardis/samplecode/customer-samplecode/collection)!
